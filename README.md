# RNA-Annotator: A Comprehensive RNA Annotation Pipeline

RNA-Annotator is a powerful, command-line tool designed to rapidly fetch, process, and visualize a rich set of genomic and functional annotations for any given human RNA transcript.

By providing either a genomic coordinate or an Ensembl Transcript ID, you can generate a full suite of publication-ready data tracks for analysis in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). This pipeline automates the complex task of aggregating data from multiple major bioinformatics databases and APIs into a single, cohesive view.

## Output Files

The pipeline generates a `results/` directory containing two subfolders:
1.  **`results/bed_tracks/`**: Contains `.bed`, `.bedGraph`, and `.wig` files formatted for direct visualization as tracks in the IGV genome browser.
2.  **`results/detailed_results/`**: Contains `.tsv` and `.csv` files with the raw, detailed information for every feature found in the analyzed region.

## Features

*   Accepts genomic coordinates (`chr:start-end`) or Ensembl Transcript IDs (`ENST...`).
*   Fetches data from major resources like Ensembl, ClinVar, Dfam, and RMBase.
*   Integrates local and remote datasets for conservation, variants, modifications, and protein binding sites.
*   Generates standard `.bed`, `.bedGraph`, and `.wig` track files.
*   Automates launching and loading all generated tracks into IGV (macOS & Linux).

## Installation

This pipeline is distributed as a Conda environment and includes installer scripts to automate the setup process.

> **Note:** The setup will download a large data package (~16 GB). Please ensure you have a stable internet connection and sufficient disk space before you begin.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moss-lab/RNA-Annotator-v1.git
cd RNA-Annotator-v1
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

The installer will automatically download the required data, create the `rna-annotator` conda environment, and set up all necessary software. Please choose the command for your operating system.

#### For macOS and Linux Users:

In your terminal, run the following command. This will take a significant amount of time due to the large data download.
```bash
chmod +x mac_linux_installer.sh
./mac_linux_installer.sh
```

#### For Windows Users:

Open **Anaconda Prompt** from your Start Menu and run the following command:
```cmd
win_installer.bat
```

## Usage

### 1. Activate the Conda Environment

Before running the tool, you **must** activate the conda environment in every new terminal session.
```bash
conda activate rna-annotator
```

### 2. Run the Tool

The basic command structure is: `python rna-annotator [QUERY] [OPTIONS]`

#### Arguments Explained

**`[QUERY]` (Required)**
The genomic region or transcript you want to analyze. This is the only required argument. It can be in one of three formats:
1.  **Genomic Coordinates:** `chr:start-end` (e.g., `chr19:58345183-58353492`)
2.  **Ensembl Transcript ID (unversioned):** `ENST...` (e.g., `ENST00000263100`)
3.  **Ensembl Transcript ID (versioned):** `ENST...` (e.g., `ENST00000263100.8`)

**`[OPTIONS]` (Optional Flags)**
These flags tell the tool which analyses to perform. You can combine as many as you like.

*   `-refseq_functional`: Extracts RefSeq functional element annotations.
*   `-eclips`: Extracts eCLIP-seq peaks to identify RNA-Binding Protein (RBP) sites.
*   `-SNP`: Fetches all known SNPs for the region from the Ensembl REST API.
*   `-miRNA`: Extracts known miRNA annotations from a local GFF3 file.
*   `-chem_mod`: Fetches known RNA chemical modifications from the RMBase database.
*   `-polyA`: Extracts polyadenylation sites from the PolyASite 2.0 database.
*   `-repeated-element`: Fetches repetitive element annotations from the Dfam API.
*   `-chemical_prop`: Extracts local chemical probing data from local WIG files.
*   `-clinvar`: Extracts clinical variants from a local ClinVar VCF file.
*   `-target_scan`: Extracts predicted miRNA binding sites from local TargetScan BED files.
*   `-phastCons`: Fetches evolutionary conservation scores (phastCons 100-way).
*   `-CpG_islands`: Extracts CpG islands from the UCSC CpG Islands Track.
*   `-SpliceVar`: Extracts Splice varients from the UCSC SpliceVarDB Track.
*   `-Alt_Events`: Extracts alternative  events from UCSC Alt Events Track.
*   `-TFs`: Extracts Transcription Factor binding sites from the UCSC TFBS Track.
*   `-igv`: After analysis, automatically launch and load results into IGV.
*   `--igv-path PATH`: **Required if using `-igv`**. Provide the full path to your IGV application.

### Examples

**Example 1: Analyze a region by coordinates and run selected analyses.**
```bash
python rna-annotator chr19:58345183-58353492 -clinvar -phastCons -SNP
```

**Example 2: Analyze a transcript by ID, run all analyses, and visualize in IGV.**
```bash
# Note: The path to IGV will be different on your system.
python rna-annotator ENST00000263100.8 -refseq_functional -eclips -SNP -miRNA -chem_mod -polyA -repeated-element -clinvar -target_scan -chemical_prop -phastCons -igv --igv-path "/Applications/IGV.app"
```

## Visualizing Results with IGV

To view the graphical representation of the results, you will need the **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)**.

If you do not have IGV installed, you can download it for free from the official Broad Institute website. The tool will guide you through the simple installation process.
*   **Download IGV here:** [https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)

You can then use the `-igv` and `--igv-path` flags as shown in the examples above to automatically load your results.
